    <body>Today is Tuesday.
Cathy lost her bag in Volkswagen taxi on Sunday.
Cathy called the Volkswagen service centre immediately.
And in these three days,went Volkswagen subsidiary company and head office two times.
Furthermore,she called &quot;110&quot; to call for help.
The driver hid the bag initially,but he surrenderd Cathy's bag three days later after his leaders' indoctrination.
The accident makes me remember her gas poisoning last time.
She utilized free legal advice to gain all of her economical loss.
So in this society, The weak are the prey of the strong. 
We should utilize any way to protect our droit.

    <body>It's my first presentation in SAP BusinessObjects on Tuesday.

After it, TL gave me some suggestion,

1. It's pretty good to express yourself with graph in slides. Here I recommend MS Visio to design software architecture.

2. TL considered my slides some incontinuous for the whole workflow. I'd better prepare a good scenario to mix up your presentation.

3. Some points were difficult to understand, so we can give a few examples to express your points.

At last, please remember!
Practice makes perfect!</body>

    <body>First of all, appreciate my girl friend, Juan Wu, for taking me to her home. My future father in law, mother, especially maternal grandma expressed pretty good feeling to me:) I think I'm the luckiest guy in the world. Anyway, Thanks to my wife in future, CCTV, MTV...&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thursday, April 30, 2009&lt;/span&gt;, Sunny&lt;br&gt;We got up at 5:30, and set off at 6:40. The bus depart from Shanghai at 7:50. We arrive at my girl friend's home at noon. My father in law drove us, three, from Xindian Town to home. I'm a shy boy, so we have only three conversation at the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;font-family: yui-tmp;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #a2a2a2; font-family: yui-tmp;&quot;&gt;- When did you depart from Shanghai?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #a2a2a2; font-family: yui-tmp;&quot;&gt;- Ten to Seven. It took a long time to take more people in the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #a2a2a2; font-family: yui-tmp;&quot;&gt;- Oh, It takes 3 hours from Shanghai to Xindian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh my god. I just have the only weapon, SMILE:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the lunch, my girl friend's grandma and a friend of my father in law came to our home. Fortunately, this uncle is good at speaking so that we are not stage wait at the table. I felt grandma is satisfied with me, because she always smile to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Friday, May 01, 2009&lt;/span&gt;, Sunny&lt;br&gt;It's Juan's birthday in the lunar calendar today. Her maternal grandma, cousin and his wife, uncle and aunt came here. We celebrate my wife's birthday. After lunch, my father in law sent me to my home by motor, and I took the bus from Chahe to Bencha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had supper at aunt's home. My younger brother and his girl friend were also at home. My mother and I took motor home after supper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Saturday, May 02, 2009&lt;/span&gt;, Rainy&lt;br&gt;It's almost rainy today, so I stayed at home. At 5:00 p.m. I bought a box of apple and milk to look visit Mr. Dong, a respective teacher at my primary middle school. He suggested me study for a master degree so that I can enter a national enterprise. He has a relative in state-owned asset commission, and he would like masters to work in his company. I think I should study for SJTU master degree or abroad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Sunday, May 03, 2009&lt;/span&gt;, Sunny&lt;br&gt;I was efficient this morning. Actually my wife said so :) Here's my shopping list:&lt;br&gt;briefs and socks:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 100&lt;br&gt;spider shoes:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 220&lt;br&gt;mingying trousers: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 80&lt;br&gt;business suit: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 180&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's emergent in this morning. After shopping, my mother went to Yangkou for bullaria, but all were sold out :( I know my wife likes to eat bullaria, so I will buy it for her next time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After lunch, I planed to take nantong's bus in the west road. But until 12:30, I didn't wait the bus. My mother had to drive me to Yangkou to take bus. Unfortunately, there's no bus to Nantong, so I had to take bus to Juegang, and I got off at Matang. My father in law brought me by moter. Thanks to my father in law, my wife and my mather in low :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the afternoon, Juan's uncle and Jingjing come for dinner.

X5_FP1_323 \ Document Properties, Global Font -- Persisting into new model SWF generation, but not canvas

Document Properties persist consistently or not at all

Global Font settings, set in Document Properties, persist into new model sessions, however only at SWF generation and not on canvas.
This presents a consistency issue.

1.  Start a model
2.  File > Document Properties > Use Global Properties > Symbol
3.  Drag a chart to canvas and verify the text is Symbol
4.  Enter preview and verify text is Symbol
5.  Click "new" button
6.  Drag a chart to canvas and verify the text is default Verdana
7.  Verify File > Document Properties > Use Global Font is not checked and is set to Verdana
8.  Enter preview
9.  Note that chart text is Symbol

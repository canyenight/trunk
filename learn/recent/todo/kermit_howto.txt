1) C-Kermit

In order to transfer files to PPCBoot, it is essential that you use a proper
terminal emulation program. It was discovered during development that minicom
does not transfer the file properly.

One tested program that works under Linux is C-Kermit, obtainable from
http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html - complete with full documentation.
Refer to its documentaiton for assistance or more information.

With C-Kermit, make .kermrc file in your home directory (typically ~/.kermrc
or $HOME/.kermitrc) and put the following lines into that file:

----- Cut Here ~/.kermrc -----
set line /dev/ttyS1
set speed 115200
set carrier-watch off
set handshake none
set flow-control none
robust
set file type bin
set file name lit
set rec pack 1000
set send pack 1000
set window 5
----- End Cut Here -----

Of course, change the serial port used in the "set line" line to whatever serial
port you're using.

2) Uploading a file to PPCBoot

2.1) At the shell prompt, type 'kermit -c' to launch the kermit program.
2.2) Boot the CerfCube. Press <Enter> when the autoboot countdown is displayed
    and the PPCBoot prompt is shown ("=> ").
2.3) Type "loadb 0x00200000" at the PPCBoot prompt to put PPCBoot into kermit
    receive mode.
2.4) Type Ctrl-\ (Ctrl-backslash), then type C to enter Kermit command mode.
2.5) At the kermit prompt, type "send <path and filename of file to send> /b".
    The download status should be displayed.
2.6) If the file was a kernel pImage, then typing "iminfo" will display
    some information about the kernel. Else, go and flash in the image.
